# Falling Dice
## A WebGL demo using Three.js and Physijs
### Jörundur Jörundsson
**NOTE**: I began with writing C code and using Emscripten to generate the JS code but ran into some issues so I decided to go ahead and write JS.

These examples provided good help:
 - https://stemkoski.github.io/Three.js/
 - https://github.com/chandlerprall/Physijs
 
 ## Instructions:
  - Download Repo and cd into directory (where `index.html` is located).
  - Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`
  - Open `localhost:8080` in browser to see results!
